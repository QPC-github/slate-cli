/*
  Section JS is concatenated together into a single file and loaded with a `defer` tag.
  Script execution will not run until the page has finished parsing.

  You cannot use liquid tags here. If you need access to section settings, you should
  use data attributes on HTML elements in `template.liquid` and can reference those
  attributes from within this file to access any required information.
