  /*
    Section settings are only accessible in CSS through inline <style> blocks.

    You can access section settings directly using liquid tags here.
    Include `section.id` or `block.id` in your selector to ensure the css applies to
    the correct instance.
      E.g. `.element-{{ section.id }} {}`.

    If you don't need to access any section settings in CSS, you can delete this file.
